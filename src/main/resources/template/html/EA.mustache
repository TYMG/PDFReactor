		<p class="lh">This is an Addendum to the Federal Direct PLUS
			(Direct PLUS) Loan Master Promissory Note (MPN) signed by the
			borrower of the Direct PLUS Loan. The borrower of a Direct PLUS Loan
			may be a graduate or professional student, or the parent of a
			dependent undergraduate student. By signing this Addendum, you are
			agreeing to repay only the loan that is identified in the Borrower
			Information section of this Addendum, if the borrower does not repay
			that loan. No additional loans may be made to the borrower under this
			MPN.</p>
		<p>This section of the Addendum contains the terms and conditions
			of the MPN signed by the borrower. Important additional information
			is also contained in the Borrower's Rights and Responsibilities
			Statement that accompanies this Addendum. As an endorser, you are not
			entitled to all of the same benefits as a Direct PLUS Loan borrower.
			For complete information regarding your rights and responsibilities
			as an endorser, please read the Borrower's Rights and
			Responsibilities Statement.</p>
		<p class="text__subheader">GOVERNING LAW</p>
		<p>
			The terms of this Master Promissory Note (MPN) will be interpreted in
			accordance with the HEA (20 U.S.C. 1070 <i>et seq</i>.), ED's
			regulations, any amendments to the HEA and the regulations in
			accordance with the effective date of those amendments, and other
			applicable federal laws and regulations. Throughout this MPN, we
			refer to these laws and regulations collectively as the "Act".
		</p>
		<p>Under applicable state law, except as preempted by federal law,
			you may have certain borrower rights, remedies, and defenses in
			addition to those stated in this MPN and the Borrower's Rights and
			Responsibilities Statement.</p>

		<p class="text__subheader">DISCLOSURE OF LOAN TERMS</p>
		<p>This MPN applies to Direct PLUS Loans. Under this MPN, the
			principal amount that you owe, and are required to repay, will be the
			sum of all disbursements that are made (unless you reduce or cancel
			any disbursements as explained below under Loan Cancellation), plus
			any unpaid interest that is capitalized and added to the principal
			balance.</p>
		<p>At or before the time of the first disbursement of each loan,
			you will receive a disclosure statement identifying the amount of the
			loan and additional terms of the loan. The Borrower's Rights and
			Responsibilities Statement accompanying this MPN contains important
			additional information. The Borrower's Rights and Responsibilities
			Statement and any disclosure statement you receive in connection with
			any loan under this MPN are hereby incorporated into this MPN.</p>
		<p>You may request additional loan funds to pay for your or the
			student's educational costs by contacting the school's financial aid
			office. The school will determine if you are eligible for any
			additional loan funds. You will be notified of any increase or other
			change in the amount of your loan.</p>
		<p>Each loan made under this MPN is separately enforceable based
			on a true and exact copy of this MPN.</p>
		<p>We may use a servicer to handle billing and other
			communications related to your loan.</p>

		<p class="text__subheader">LOAN CANCELLATION</p>
		<p>You may pay back all or part of a loan disbursement within the
			timeframes set by the Act, as explained in the Borrower's Rights and
			Responsibilities Statement and in a disclosure statement that you
			will receive. If you return the full loan amount within those
			timeframes, you will not have to pay any loan fee or interest
			charges. If you return part of a disbursement within those
			timeframes, ED will reduce the loan fee and interest charges in
			proportion to the amount returned.</p>

		<p class="text__subheader">INTEREST</p>
		<p>Unless we notify you in writing that a different rate will
			apply, the interest rate for any loan you receive under this MPN is a
			fixed rate that is calculated in accordance with a formula specified
			in the Act. The interest rate for Direct PLUS Loans is calculated
			each year. When the rate is calculated, it applies to Direct PLUS
			Loans for which the first disbursement is made during the period
			beginning on July 1 of one year and ending on June 30 of the
			following year. Different interest rates may apply to different loans
			you receive under this MPN, depending on when the loan is first
			disbursed. The maximum interest rate for Direct PLUS Loans is 10.5%.
			We will notify you of the interest rate on each of your loans.</p>
		<p>If you are in the military and the interest rate on your loan
			is greater than 6%, you may qualify to have the rate limited to 6%
			during your period of service. In addition, under the no accrual of
			interest benefit for active duty service members, you are not
			required to pay the interest that accrues on any type of Direct Loan
			Program loan first disbursed on or after October 1, 2008 during
			periods of qualifying active duty military service (for up to 60
			months).</p>

		<p>Interest accrues on the unpaid principal balance of each loan
			from the date of disbursement until the loan is paid in full,
			including during deferment, forbearance, or other periods. Except
			during certain periods of repayment under the Revised Pay As You Earn
			Repayment Plan (REPAYE Plan), you agree to pay all interest charges
			on your loan. (The REPAYE Plan is not available to parent borrowers.)
			You will be given the opportunity to pay the interest that accrues
			during a period of authorized deferment or forbearance. If you do not
			pay this interest, we may capitalize the interest (add it to the
			principal balance of your loans) at the end of the deferment or
			forbearance.</p>

		<p class="text__subheader">LOAN FEE</p>
		<p>As provided by the Act, we charge a loan fee for each Direct
			PLUS Loan you receive under this MPN. The loan fee is a percentage of
			the loan amount and will be deducted proportionately from each
			disbursement of each of your loans. The specific loan fee that you
			are charged will be shown on disclosure statements that will be sent
			to you. We may refund the loan fee only as permitted by the Act.</p>

		<p class="text__subheader">LATE CHARGES AND COLLECTION COSTS</p>
		<p>We may collect from you:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>A late charge of not more than six cents for each
					dollar of each late payment if you do not make any part of a
					required installment payment within 30 days after it becomes due,
					and</p></li>
			<li><p>Any other charges and fees that are permitted by the
					Act related to the collection of your loans.</p></li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you default on your loans, you must pay reasonable
			collection costs, plus court costs and attorney fees.</p>

		<p class="text__subheader">REPAYMENT</p>
		<p>You must repay the full amount of the loans made under this
			MPN, plus accrued interest. You will repay each loan in monthly
			installments during a repayment period that begins on the day of the
			final disbursement of that loan. Generally, payments that you make or
			that someone else makes on your behalf will be applied first to late
			charges and collection costs that are due, then to interest that has
			not been paid, and finally to the principal amount of the loan.
			However, any payments made under the REPAYE Plan, the Pay As You Earn
			Repayment Plan (PAYE Plan), and the Income-Based Repayment Plan (IBR
			Plan) will be applied first to interest that is due, then to fees
			that are due, and then to the principal amount. The REPAYE, PAYE, and
			IBR plans are not available to parent borrowers.</p>
		<p>You have a choice of repayment plans. The Borrower's Rights and
			Responsibilities Statement includes information on these repayment
			plans. You must select a repayment plan. If you do not select a
			repayment plan, we will choose a plan for you in accordance with the
			Act.</p>
		<p>Once you choose a repayment plan, we will provide you with a
			repayment schedule that identifies your payment amounts and due
			dates. If you intend to repay your loan but are unable to make your
			scheduled loan payments, we may grant you a forbearance that allows
			you to temporarily stop making payments or to temporarily make a
			smaller payment amount, which extends the time for making payments.</p>

		<p>We may adjust payment dates on your loans or may grant you a
			forbearance to eliminate a delinquency that remains even though you
			are making scheduled installment payments.</p>
		<p>You may prepay all or any part of the unpaid balance on your
			loans at any time without penalty. We will determine how to apply the
			prepayment in accordance with the Act.</p>
		<p>After you have repaid in full a loan made under this MPN, we
			will send you a notice telling you that you have paid off your loan.</p>
		<p class="text__subheader">ACCELERATION AND DEFAULT</p>
		<p>At our option, the entire unpaid balance of a loan made under
			this MPN will become immediately due and payable (this is called
			"acceleration") if any one of the following events occurs:</p>
		<p>
			<b>(1)</b> You (or the student) do not begin attendance in any
			classes at the school that determined you were eligible to receive

		</p>
		<p>
			<b>(2)</b> You do not use the loan money solely for your or the
			student's educational expenses;
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>(3)</b> You make a false representation that results in your
			receiving a loan for which you are not eligible; or
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>(4)</b> You default on the loan.
		</p>
		<p>You will be considered in default on your loan if:</p>
		<p>
			<b>(1)</b> The full unpaid balance of the loan becomes immediately
			due and payable because event (1), (2), or (3) above occurs, and you
			do not pay the amount due;
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>(2)</b> You do not make installment payments when due, and your
			failure to make payments has continued for at least 270 days; or
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>(3)</b> You do not comply with other terms of the loan, and we
			reasonably conclude that you no longer intend to honor your repayment
			obligation.
		</p>
		<p>If you default, we may capitalize all outstanding interest.
			This will increase the principal balance of your loan, and the full
			amount of the loan, including the new principal balance and
			collection costs, will become immediately due and payable.</p>
		<p>If you default, the default will be reported to nationwide
			consumer reporting agencies (credit bureaus) and will significantly
			and adversely affect your credit history. A default will have
			additional adverse consequences as explained in the Borrower's Rights
			and Responsibilities Statement. Following default, you may be
			required to repay the loan (potentially including amounts in excess
			of the principal and interest) under the IBR Plan, the PAYE Plan, the
			REPAYE Plan, or the Income-Contingent Repayment Plan (ICR Plan) in
			accordance with the Act.</p>

		<p class="note-to-endorser">
			<b>NOTE TO ENDORSER</b><br> An endorser is someone who agrees to
			repay a Direct PLUS Loan if the borrower does not repay the loan. If
			you are the endorser of a Direct PLUS Loan, you are not entitled to
			all of the same benefits as a Direct PLUS Loan borrower, and not all

		<p class="text__subheader">
			1. THE WILLIAM D. FORD FEDERAL DIRECT LOAN PROGRAM</b>
		<p>The William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program
			includes the following types of loans, known collectively as "Direct
			Loans":</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Federal Direct Stafford/Ford Loans (Direct Subsidized Loans)</li>
			<li>Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford/Ford Loans (Direct
				Unsubsidized Loans)</li>
			<li>Federal Direct PLUS Loans (Direct PLUS Loans)</li>
			<li>Federal Direct Consolidation Loans (Direct Consolidation
				Loans)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			The Direct Loan Program is authorized by Title IV, Part D, of the
			Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), 20 U.S.C. 1070 <i>et
				seq</i>.
		</p>
		<p>Direct Loans are made by the U.S. Department of Education. We
			contract with servicers to service, answer questions about, and
			process payments on Direct Loans. Your servicer will provide you with
			its address and telephone number after the school notifies us that
			the first disbursement of your loan has been made. It is important to
			keep in contact with your servicer.</p>


		<p class="text__subheader">2. LAWS THAT APPLY TO THIS MPN</p>
		<p>The terms and conditions of loans made under this MPN are
			determined by the HEA and other applicable federal laws and
			regulations. These laws and regulations are referred to as "the Act"
			throughout this Borrower's Rights and Responsibilities Statement.
			Under applicable state law, except as preempted by federal law, you
			may have certain borrower rights, remedies, and defenses in addition
			to those stated in the MPN and this Borrower's Rights and
			Responsibilities Statement.</p>
		<p>
			<b>NOTE: Any amendment to the Act that affects the terms of this
				MPN will be applied to your loans in accordance with the effective
				date of the amendment.</b>
		</p>

		<p class="text__subheader">3. DIRECT PLUS LOANS</p>
		<p>Direct PLUS Loans are loans made to graduate or professional
			students or to parents of dependent undergraduate students to help
			pay for the cost of education beyond high school ("dependent" is
			defined in the Act and is different from the definition used by the
			Internal Revenue Service). To be eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>You must be a graduate or professional student or the
					biological or adoptive parent of the dependent undergraduate
					student for whom</p>
				<p class="break-column">you are borrowing. If you are the spouse
					of the dependent undergraduate student's parent (that is, if you
					are the student's stepparent), you may borrow a Direct PLUS Loan if
					you are considered to be a parent in accordance with the
					instructions on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid
					(FAFSA) for purposes of reporting your income and assets on the
					FAFSA.</p></li>
			<li>You, and if you are a parent borrower, your child, must be a
				U.S. citizen or national, a permanent resident of the United States,
				or an otherwise eligible non-citizen.</li>
			<li>You, and if you are a parent borrower, your child, must not
				be in default on a federal education loan or owe an overpayment on a
				federal education grant, and must not have been convicted of, or
				have pled <i>nolo contendere</i> (no contest) or guilty to, a crime
				involving fraud in obtaining funds under the Act.
			</li>
			<li>You must not have an adverse credit history (unless you meet
				certain other requirements - see below).</li>
			<li>You, or if you are a parent borrower, your child, must be
				enrolled at least half-time at a school that participates in the
				Direct Loan Program.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>We will check your credit history each time you request a
			Direct PLUS Loan. If you have an adverse credit history, you may not
			borrow a Direct PLUS Loan unless you:</p>
		<p>(1) Obtain an endorser who does not have an adverse credit
			history, or document to our satisfaction that there are extenuating
			circumstances related to the adverse credit history, and</p>
		<p>(2) Complete Direct PLUS Loan credit counseling that we
			provide.</p>

		<p>An endorser is someone who agrees to repay the Direct PLUS Loan
			if you do not do so. If you are a parent borrower, the endorser of a
			Direct PLUS Loan may not be the student for whom you are borrowing
			the loan.</p>
		<p>If you are a graduate or professional student, you must
			complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and your
			school must determine your eligibility for the maximum annual Direct
			Unsubsidized Loan amount before you apply for a Direct PLUS Loan.</p>
		<p>If you have questions about your eligibility for a Direct PLUS
			Loan, contact the financial aid office at the school you attend or
			are planning to attend or, if you are a parent borrower, the school
			the student attends or is planning to attend.</p>

		<p class="text__subheader">4. ABOUT THE MPN</p>
		<p>You may receive more than one loan under this MPN over a period
			of up to 10 years to pay for your educational costs (if you are a
			graduate or professional student borrower) or for the educational
			costs of the student identified in the Dependent Undergraduate
			Student Information section of the MPN (if you are a parent
			borrower), as long as the school is authorized to use the multi-year
			feature of the MPN and chooses to do so.</p>
		<p>If the school is not authorized to use the multi-year feature
			of the MPN or chooses not to do so, or if you do not want to receive
			more than one loan under this MPN, you must sign a new MPN for each
			loan that you receive. If you do not want to receive more than one
			loan under this MPN, you must notify the school or your servicer in
			writing.</p>
		<p>If you are a parent requesting more than one Direct PLUS Loan
			to pay for the educational costs of more than one dependent
			undergraduate student, you must sign a separate MPN for each student.
			You must also sign separate MPNs if you are a parent borrowing on
			behalf of a dependent undergraduate student and you also wish to
			obtain a Direct PLUS Loan to pay for your own attendance in a
			graduate or professional degree program.</p>

		<p>If we determine that you have an adverse credit history and you
			obtain an endorser (see Item 3, "Direct PLUS Loans"), you may receive

			Direct PLUS Loan, you must sign a new MPN. If you receive a loan
			under this MPN without an endorser, but are later determined to have
			an adverse credit history and obtain an endorser for a future Direct
			PLUS Loan, you will have to sign a new MPN for that loan.</p>


		<p class="text__subheader">5. DIRECT PLUS LOANS AND ELIGIBILITY
			FOR OTHER FINANCIAL AID</p>

		<p>If you borrow a Direct PLUS Loan, this may affect your
			eligibility for other financial aid. Therefore, we suggest that you
			contact the school's financial aid office to determine your
			eligibility for grants, work-study funds, or other forms of federal,
			state and private student aid that do not have to be repaid before
			you apply for a Direct PLUS Loan.</p>


		<p class="text__subheader">6. USE OF YOUR LOAN MONEY</p>

		<p>You may use the loan money you receive only to pay for your
			authorized educational expenses or, if you are a parent borrower, for
			the student's authorized educational expenses for attendance at the
			school that determined you were eligible to receive the loan.
			Authorized expenses include the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Tuition</li>
			<li>Room</li>
			<li>Board</li>
			<li>Institutional fees</li>
			<li>Books</li>
			<li>Supplies</li>
			<li>Equipment</li>
			<li>Dependent care expenses</li>
			<li>Transportation</li>
			<li>Commuting expenses</li>
			<li>Rental or purchase of a personal computer</li>
			<li>Loan fees</li>
			<li>Other documented, authorized costs</li>
		</ul>


		<p class="text__subheader">7. INFORMATION YOU MUST REPORT TO US
			AFTER YOU RECEIVE YOUR LOAN</p>

		<p>You must notify your servicer and/or the financial aid office
			at the school about certain changes.</p>
		<p>Until you (or if you are a parent borrower, the student)
			graduate or otherwise leave school, you must notify the school's
			financial aid office if:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You change your address or telephone number;</li>
			<li>You change your name (for example, maiden name to married
				name); or</li>
			<li>You (or if you are a parent borrower, the student) -
				<ul>
					<li>Do not enroll at least half-time for the loan period
						certified by the school;</li>
					<li>Do not enroll at the school that determined you were
						eligible to receive the loan;</li>
					<li>Stop attending school or drop below half-time enrollment;</li>
					<li>Transfer from one school to another school; or</li>
					<li>Graduate.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>You must also notify your servicer if any of the above events
			occur at any time after you receive your loan. In addition, you must
			notify your servicer if you:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Change your employer, or your employer's address or
				telephone number changes; or</li>
			<li>Have any other change in status that would affect your loan
				(for example, if you receive a deferment while you are unemployed,
				but you find a job and therefore no longer meet the eligibility
				requirements for the deferment).</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="note-to-endorser">
			<b>NOTE TO ENDORSER</b><br>You must notify the servicer if you
			change your address, telephone number, name, or employer, or if your
			employer's address or telephone number changes.
		</p>


		<p class="text__subheader">8. AMOUNT YOU MAY BORROW</p>

		<p>For each academic year, you may borrow up to - but not more
			than - the amount of your estimated cost of attendance (if you are a
			graduate or professional student borrower) or the student's estimated
			cost of attendance (if you are a parent borrower), minus the amount
			of any other financial aid received for that academic year. The
			school determines the cost of attendance using federal guidelines. It
			is important not to borrow more than you can afford to repay, even if
			you are eligible to borrow more.</p>


		<p class="text__subheader">9. INTEREST RATE</p>

		<p>The interest rate on a Direct PLUS Loan is a fixed rate that is
			calculated in accordance with a formula specified in the Act. The
			interest rate is calculated each year. When the rate is calculated,
			it applies to all Direct PLUS Loans for which the first disbursement
			is made during the period beginning on July 1 of one year and ending
			on June 30 of the following year. Different fixed interest rates may
			apply to separate loans made under this MPN depending on when the
			loan is first disbursed. The maximum interest rate for Direct PLUS
			Loans is 10.5%. We will notify you of the interest rate for each loan
			you receive in a disclosure statement that we send to you.</p>

		<p>
			<b>Servicemembers Civil Relief Act</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>If you are in military service, you may qualify for a lower
				interest rate on your loans.</b>
		</p>

		<p>Under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, the interest rate on
			loans you received before you began your military service may be
			limited to 6% during your military service. In most cases, your
			servicer will determine if you are eligible for this benefit based on
			information from the U.S. Department of Defense, and, if any of your
			qualifying loans have an interest rate greater than 6%, will
			automatically reduce that rate to 6% during your military service. If
			you think you qualify for the 6% interest rate but have not received
			it, contact your servicer. Your servicer can also provide more
			information about this benefit.</p>
		<p>If you have an adverse credit history and receive a Direct PLUS
			Loan by obtaining an endorser, you will also qualify for the 6%
			interest rate limit on that Direct PLUS Loan if the endorser
			qualifies for the limit based on the endorser's military service (see
			the Note to Endorser below).</p>

		<p class="note-to-endorser">
			<b>NOTE TO ENDORSER</b><br>You may be eligible for the reduced
			interest rate described above based on the borrower's military
			service or your own military service if you are the endorser for a
			Direct PLUS Loan for which you signed an Endorser Addendum prior to
			the earlier of the beginning date of the borrower's military service
			or the beginning date of your military service.
		</p>



		<p class="text__subheader">10. PAYMENT OF INTEREST</p>
		<p>Except as provided below for borrowers who serve in the
			military, and (for Direct PLUS Loans made to graduate or professional
			degree students) during certain periods of repayment under the REPAYE
			Plan, you are responsible for paying the interest that accrues on
			each Direct PLUS Loan you receive from the date the loan is first
			disbursed until it is repaid in full, including during periods of
			deferment or forbearance.</p>

			<b>No accrual of interest benefit for active duty service members</b>
		</p>

		<p>Under the no accrual of interest benefit for active duty
			service members, you are not required to pay the interest that
			accrues on any type of Direct Loan Program loan first disbursed on or
			after October 1, 2008 during periods of qualifying active duty
			military service (for up to 60 months).</p>

		<p>
			<b>Interest capitalization</b>
		</p>

		<p>If you do not pay the interest as it accrues on a Direct PLUS
			Loan, as described above, we will add the accrued interest to the
			unpaid principal balance of your loan. This is called
			"capitalization." Capitalization increases the unpaid principal
			balance of your loan, and interest then accrues on the increased
			principal balance. We capitalize unpaid interest when you resume
			repayment after periods of deferment or forbearance. We may also
			capitalize unpaid interest that has accrued since the first
			disbursement of your loan when you enter repayment for the first
			time.</p>

		<p>The chart that follows shows the difference in the total amount
			you would repay on a $15,000 Direct PLUS Loan if you pay the interest
			as it is charged during a 12-month deferment or forbearance period,
			compared to the amount you would repay if you do not pay the interest
			and it is capitalized.</p>

		<p>The example in the chart above shows payments made under the
			Standard Repayment Plan at an interest rate of 10.5%, the maximum

			$22 less per month and $975 less altogether if you pay the interest
			as it is charged during a 12-month deferment or forbearance period.</p>



		<b>Federal income tax deduction</b>


		<p>
			You may be able to claim a federal income tax deduction for interest
			payments you make on Direct Loans. For further information, refer to
			IRS Publication 970, which is available at <a
				href="http://www.irs.ustreas.gov/" target="_blank">http://www.irs.ustreas.gov</a>.
		</p>


		<p class="text__subheader">11. LOAN FEE</p>

		<p>For each Direct PLUS Loan you receive under this MPN, we charge
			a loan fee that is a percentage of the principal amount of each loan.
			This fee will be subtracted proportionally from each disbursement of
			your loan and will be shown on a disclosure statement that we send to
			you.</p>


		<p class="text__subheader">12. INTEREST RATE REDUCTION FOR
			AUTOMATIC WITHDRAWAL OF PAYMENTS</p>

		<p>Under the automatic withdrawal option, your bank automatically
			deducts your monthly loan payment from your checking or savings
			account and sends it to us. Automatic withdrawal helps to ensure that
			your payments are made on time. In addition, you receive a 0.25%
			interest rate reduction while you repay under the automatic
			withdrawal option. Your servicer will provide you with information
			about the automatic withdrawal option. You can also get the
			information on your servicer's web site, or by calling your servicer.
			Your servicer's web site address and toll-free telephone number are
			provided on all correspondence that your servicer sends you.</p>


		<p class="text__subheader">13. DISBURSEMENT (HOW YOUR LOAN MONEY
			WILL BE PAID OUT)</p>

		<p>Generally, the school will disburse (pay out) your loan money
			in more than one installment, usually at the beginning of each
			academic term (for example, at the beginning of each semester or
			quarter). If the school does not use academic terms or does not have
			academic terms that meet certain requirements, it will generally
			disburse your loan in at least two installments, one at the beginning
			of the period of study for which you are receiving the loan, and one
			at the midpoint of that period of study. The school determines the
			schedule for disbursing your loan money in accordance with the Act.</p>
		<p>The school may disburse some or all of your loan money by
			crediting it to your account at the school (if you are a graduate or
			professional student borrower) or to the student's account at the
			school (if you are a parent borrower), or may give it to you directly
			by check or other means. Your servicer will notify you in writing
			each time the school disburses part of your loan money.</p>
		<p>If you are a graduate or professional student and have not
			previously received a Direct PLUS Loan or a Federal PLUS Loan under
			the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program, you must receive
			entrance counseling before your school can make the first
			disbursement of your loan. Your school will tell you if entrance
			counseling is required, and will provide instructions for completing
			entrance counseling.</p>
		<p>If the school credits your loan money to your or the student's
			account and the amount credited is more than the amount of the
			tuition and fees, room and board, and other authorized charges, the
			excess amount is called a credit balance.</p>
		<p>Unless you authorize the school to hold the credit balance for
			you, the school must pay you the credit balance within the following
			timeframes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If the credit balance occurs after the first day of class of
				a payment period (the school can tell you this date), the school
				must pay you the credit balance no later than 14 days after the date
				the balance occurs.</li>
			<li>If the credit balance occurs on or before the first day of
				class of a payment period, the school must pay you the credit
				balance no later than 14 days after the first day of class of the
				payment period.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you are a parent borrower, you may authorize the school to
			pay the credit balance to the student.</p>

		<p class="text__subheader">14. CANCELING YOUR LOAN</p>


		<p>Before your loan money is disbursed, you may cancel all or part
			of your loan at any time by notifying the school. After your loan
			money is disbursed, there are two ways to cancel all or part of your
			loan:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>
					<b>You may notify the school (within certain timeframes).</b> If
					the school obtains your written confirmation of the types and
					amounts of Title IV loans that you want to receive for an award
					year before crediting loan money to your or the student's account
					at the school, you may tell the school that you want to cancel all
					or part of that loan within 14 days after the date the school
					notifies you of your right to cancel all or part of the loan, or by
					the first day of the school's payment period, whichever is later
					(the school can tell you the first day of the payment period).

			cancelled or returned.</p>

		<p>
		<p class="text__subheader">15. REPAYING YOUR LOAN</p>
		<p>The repayment period for each Direct PLUS Loan made under this
			MPN begins on the date of the final disbursement for that loan. This
			means that the repayment period for each loan you receive under this
			MPN will begin on a different date. Unless you receive a deferment or
			forbearance (see Item 21), your first payment on each loan will be
			due within 60 days of the date of the final disbursement of that
			loan. Your servicer will notify you of the date your first payment is
			due.</p>


		<p>You must make payments on your loan even if you do not receive
			a bill or repayment notice.</p>

		<p>You must repay all of your Direct Loans under the same
			repayment plan, unless you want to repay your loans under the REPAYE
			Plan, the PAYE Plan, the IBR Plan, or the ICR Plan (see below) and
			you have other Direct Loans that do not qualify for repayment under
			those plans. In that case, you may select the REPAYE, PAYE, IBR, or
			ICR plan for the loans that are eligible for repayment under those
			plans, and may select a different repayment plan for the loans that
			may not be repaid under the REPAYE, PAYE, IBR, or ICR plan. Direct
			PLUS Loans made to a parent borrower may not be repaid under the
			REPAYE, PAYE, IBR and ICR plans.</p>

		<p>Before your Direct PLUS Loan enters repayment, we will ask you
			to choose one of the repayment plans listed below. If you do not
			choose a repayment plan, we will place you on the Standard Repayment
			Plan.</p>

		<p>
			<b>Repayment plans for all Direct PLUS Loan borrowers</b>
		</p>

		<p>The following repayment plans are available to all Direct PLUS
			Loan borrowers:</p>

		<p>
			<b>Standard Repayment Plan</b>
		</p>

		<p>Under the Standard Repayment Plan, you will make fixed monthly
			payments and repay your loan in full within 10 years (not including
			periods of deferment or forbearance) from the date the loan entered
			repayment. Your payments must be at least $50 a month ($600 a year)
			and will be more, if necessary, to repay the loan within the required
			time period.</p>

		<p>
			<b>Graduated Repayment Plan</b>
		</p>

		<p>Under the Graduated Repayment Plan, you will usually make lower
			payments at first, and your payments will gradually increase over
			time. You will repay your loan in full within 10 years (not including
			periods of deferment or forbearance) from the date the loan entered
			repayment. Your scheduled monthly payment must at least be equal to
			the amount of interest that accrues each month. No single scheduled
			payment will be more than three times greater than any other payment.</p>

		<p>
			<b>Extended Repayment Plan</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			You are eligible for the Extended Repayment Plan only if <b>(1)</b>
			you have an outstanding balance on Direct Loans that exceeds $30,000,
			and <b>(2)</b> you had no outstanding balance on a Direct Loan as of
			October 7, 1998 or on the date you obtained a Direct Loan on or after
			October 7, 1998.
		</p>

		<p>Under this plan, you will repay your loan in full over a period
			not to exceed 25 years (not including periods of deferment or
			forbearance) from the date the loan entered repayment. You may choose
			to make fixed monthly payments or graduated monthly payments that
			start out lower and gradually increase over time. If you make fixed
			monthly payments, your payments must be at least $50 a month ($600 a
			year) and will be more, if necessary, to repay the loan within the
			required time period. If you make graduated payments, your scheduled
			monthly payment must at least be equal to the amount of interest that
			accrues each month. No single scheduled payment under the graduated
			option will be more than three times greater than any other payment.</p>


		<p>
			<b>Additional repayment plans only for graduate and professional
				student Direct PLUS Loan borrowers</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Note: Parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers may not repay their
				Direct PLUS Loans under these plans. However, if a parent Direct
				PLUS Loan borrower consolidates a Direct PLUS Loan into a Direct
				Consolidation Loan, the Direct Consolidation Loan may then be repaid
				under the ICR Plan described below. See Item 23 for information on
				loan consolidation.</b>
		</p>

		<p>If you are a graduate or professional student Direct PLUS Loan
			borrower, the following additional repayment plans are available:</p>


		<b>Revised Pay As You Earn Repayment Plan (REPAYE Plan)</b>

		<p>Under the REPAYE Plan, your monthly payment amount is generally
			10% of your discretionary income. Discretionary income for this plan
			is the difference between your adjusted gross income and 150% of the
			poverty guideline amount for your state of residence and family size,
			divided by 12.</p>

		<p>If you are married, the income used to determine your REPAYE
			Plan payment amount will generally be the combined income of you and
			your spouse, regardless of whether you file a joint or separate
			federal income tax return.</p>

		<p>While you are repaying under the REPAYE Plan, you must provide
			documentation of your income (and, if you are married, your spouse's
			income) and certify your family size each year so that we may
			recalculate your payment amount.</p>

		<p>Under the REPAYE Plan, if all of the loans you are repaying
			under the plan were obtained for undergraduate study, any remaining
			loan amount will be forgiven after you have made the equivalent of 20
			years of qualifying monthly payments over a period of at least 20
			years. If any of the loans you are repaying under the REPAYE Plan
			were obtained for graduate or professional study, any remaining loan
			amount will be forgiven after you have made the equivalent of 25
			years of qualifying monthly payments over a period of at least 25
			years. You may have to pay federal income tax on the loan amount that
			is forgiven.</p>

		<p>
			<b>Pay As You Earn Repayment Plan (PAYE Plan)</b>
		</p>

		<p>Under the PAYE Plan, your monthly payment amount is generally
			10% of your discretionary income. Discretionary income for this plan
			is the difference between your adjusted gross income and 150% of the
			poverty guideline amount for your state of residence and family size,
			divided by 12.</p>

		<p>If you are married and file a joint federal income tax return,
			the income used to determine your PAYE Plan payment amount will be
			the combined adjusted gross income of you and your spouse.</p>

		<p>If you are married and file a separate federal income tax
			return from your spouse, only your individual adjusted gross income
			will be used to determine your PAYE Plan payment amount.</p>

		<p>The PAYE Plan is available only to new borrowers. You are a new
			borrower for the PAYE Plan if:</p>
		<p>
			<b>(1)</b> You had no outstanding balance on a Direct Loan or a FFEL
			Program loan as of October 1, 2007, or you have no outstanding
			balance on a Direct Loan or a FFEL Program loan when you obtain a new
			loan on or after October 1, 2007, and
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>(2)</b> You receive a disbursement of a Direct Subsidized Loan,
			Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan (a Direct PLUS
			Loan made to a graduate or professional student) on or after October
			1, 2011, or you receive a Direct Consolidation Loan based on an
			application received on or after October 1, 2011. However, you are
			not considered to be a new borrower for the PAYE Plan if the Direct
			Consolidation Loan you receive repays loans that would make you
			ineligible under part <b>(1)</b> of this definition.
		</p>

		<p>In addition to being a new borrower, to initially qualify for
			the PAYE Plan, the monthly amount you would be required to pay under
			this plan, based on your income and family size, must be less than
			the amount you would have to pay under the Standard Repayment Plan.</p>

		<p>If you are married and file a joint federal income tax return,
			the loan amount we use to determine whether you qualify for the PAYE
			Plan will include your eligible loans and your spouse's eligible
			loans.</p>

		<p>If you are married and file a separate federal income tax
			return from your spouse, the loan amount we use to determine whether
			you qualify for the PAYE Plan will include only your eligible loans.</p>

		<p>While you are repaying under the PAYE Plan, you must provide
			documentation of your income and certify your family size each year
			so that we may recalculate your payment amount. If your income
			increases to the point that the amount you would have to pay under
			the PAYE Plan based on your income is more than what you would have
			to pay under the Standard Repayment Plan, you will remain on the PAYE
			Plan, but your monthly payment will no longer be based on your
			income. Instead, your monthly payment will be what you would be
			required to pay under the Standard Repayment Plan.</p>

		<p>Under the PAYE Plan, if your loan is not repaid in full after
			you have made the equivalent of 20 years of qualifying monthly
			payments over a period of at least 20 years, any remaining loan
			amount will be forgiven. You may have to pay federal income tax on
			the loan amount that is forgiven.</p>
		<p>
			<b>Income-Based Repayment Plan (IBR Plan)</b>
		</p>

		<p>Under the IBR Plan, your monthly payment amount is generally
			15% (10% if you are a new borrower; see Note below) of your
			discretionary income. Discretionary income for this plan is the
			difference between your adjusted gross income and 150% of the poverty
			guideline amount for your state of residence and family size, divided
			by 12.</p>

		<p>If you are married and file a joint federal income tax return,
			the income used to determine your IBR Plan payment amount will be the
			combined adjusted gross income of you and your spouse.</p>


		<p>If you are married and file a separate federal income tax
			return from your spouse, only your individual adjusted gross income
			will be used to determine your IBR Plan payment amount.</p>

		<p>To initially qualify for the IBR Plan, the monthly amount you
			would be required to pay under this plan, based on your income and
			family size, must be less than the amount you would have to pay under
			the Standard Repayment Plan.</p>

		<p>If you are married and file a joint federal income tax return,
			the loan amount we use to determine whether you qualify for the IBR
			Plan will include your eligible loans and your spouse's eligible
			loans.</p>

		<p>If you are married and file a separate federal income tax
			return from your spouse, the loan amount we use to determine whether
			you qualify for the IBR Plan will include only your eligible loans.</p>

		<p>While you are repaying under the IBR Plan, you must provide
			documentation of your income and certify your family size each year
			so that we may recalculate your payment amount. If your income
			increases to the point that the amount you would have to pay under
			the IBR Plan based on your income is more than what you would have to
			pay under the Standard Repayment Plan, you will remain on the IBR
			Plan, but your monthly payment will no longer be based on your
			income. Instead, your monthly payment will be what you would be
			required to pay under the Standard Repayment Plan.</p>

		<p>Under the IBR Plan, if your loan is not repaid in full after
			you have made the equivalent of 25 years (20 years if you are a new
			borrower) of qualifying monthly payments over a period of at least 25
			years (20 years if you are a new borrower), any remaining loan amount
			will be forgiven. You may have to pay federal income tax on the loan
			amount that is forgiven.</p>
		<p>
			<b>NOTE:</b> You are a new borrower for the IBR Plan if you have no
			outstanding balance on a Direct Loan or a FFEL Program loan on July
			1, 2014, or if you have no outstanding balance on a Direct Loan or a
			FFEL Program loan on the date you obtain a Direct Loan after July 1,
			2014. Your servicer will determine whether you are a new borrower
			based on the information about your loans in the U.S. Department of
			Education's National Student Loan Data System.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Income Contingent Repayment Plan (ICR Plan)</b>
		</p>
		<p>Under the ICR Plan, your monthly payment amount will be either
			20% of your discretionary income or a percentage of what you would
			repay under a Standard Repayment Plan with a 12-year repayment
			period, whichever is less. Discretionary income for this plan is the
			difference between your adjusted gross income and the poverty
			guideline amount for your state of residence and family size, divided
			by 12.</p>
		<p>If you are married and file a joint federal income tax return,
			the income used to determine your ICR Plan payment amount will be the
			combined adjusted gross income of you and your spouse.</p>
		<p>If you are married and file a separate federal income tax
			return from your spouse, only your individual adjusted gross income
			will be used to determine your ICR Plan payment amount.</p>
		<p>Until we obtain the information needed to calculate your
			monthly payment amount, your payment will equal the amount of
			interest that accrues monthly on your loan unless you request a
			forbearance.</p>

		<p>
			You can use the Repayment Estimator at <a

			to estimate your monthly and total payment amounts under the

		</p>
		<p>If you do not make any part of a payment within 30 days after

		<p>
		<p class="text__subheader">19. DEFAULTING ON YOUR LOAN</p>
		<p>Default (failing to repay your loan) is defined in detail in
			the MPN Terms and Conditions section of your MPN. If you default:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>We will require you to immediately repay the entire unpaid
				amount of your loan.</li>
			<li>We may sue you, take all or part of your federal and state
				tax refunds and other federal or state payments, and/or garnish your
				wages so that your employer is required to send us part of your
				salary to pay off your loan.</li>
			<li>We will require you to pay reasonable collection fees and
				costs, plus court costs and attorney fees.</li>
			<li>You will lose eligibility for other federal student aid and
				assistance under most federal benefit programs.</li>
			<li>You will lose eligibility for loan deferments.</li>
			<li>We will also report your default to nationwide consumer
				reporting agencies (see Item 20). This will harm your credit history
				and may make it difficult for you to obtain credit cards, home or
				car loans, or other forms of consumer credit.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you default on your loan, you will not be charged collection
			costs if you respond within 60 days to the initial notice of default
			that we send to you, and you enter into a repayment agreement with
			us, including a loan rehabilitation agreement, and fulfill that
			agreement.</p>

		<p class="note-to-endorser">
			<b>NOTE TO ENDORSER</b> If the borrower defaults on the loan, and you
			do not make payments on the loan, you may also be subject to the
			actions described above.
		</p>
		<p>
		<p class="text__subheader">20. CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY
			NOTIFICATION</p>
		<p>We will report information about your loan to nationwide
			consumer reporting agencies (commonly known as "credit bureaus") on a
			regular basis. This information will include the disbursement dates,
			amount, and repayment status of your loan (for example, whether you
			are current or delinquent in making payments). Your loan will be
			identified as an education loan.</p>
		<p>
			If you default on a loan, we will report this to nationwide consumer
			reporting agencies. We will notify you at least 30 days in advance
			that we plan to report default information to a consumer reporting
			agency unless you resume making payments on the loan within 30 days
			of the date of the notice. You will be given a chance to ask for a
			review of the debt before we report it.<br>

			(POSTPONING PAYMENTS)</p>
		<b>General</b>
		<p>If you meet certain requirements, you may receive a deferment
			that allows you to temporarily stop making payments on your loan. If
			you cannot make your scheduled loan payments, but do not qualify for
			a deferment, we may give you a forbearance. A forbearance allows you
			to temporarily stop making payments on your loan, temporarily make
			smaller payments, or extend the time for making payments.</p>

		<b>Deferment</b>
		<p>You may receive a deferment:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>While you are enrolled at least half-time at an eligible
				school;</li>
			<li>During the 6-month period after you cease to be enrolled at
				least half-time;</li>
			<li>While the student for whom you obtained a Direct PLUS Loan
				is enrolled at least half-time at an eligible school;</li>
			<li>During the 6-month period after the student for whom you
				obtained a Direct PLUS Loan ceases to be enrolled at least
				half-time;</li>
			<li>While you are in a full-time course of study in a graduate
				fellowship program;</li>
			<li>While you are in an approved full-time rehabilitation
				program for individuals with disabilities;</li>
			<li>While you are unemployed (for a maximum of three years; you
				must be diligently seeking, but unable to find, full-time
				employment);</li>
			<li>While you are experiencing an economic hardship (including
				Peace Corps service), as defined in the Act (for a maximum of three
				years);</li>
			<li>While you are serving on active duty during a war or other
				military operation or national emergency or performing qualifying
				National Guard duty during a war or other military operation or
				national emergency and, if you were serving on or after October 1,
				2007, for an additional 180-day period following the demobilization
				date for your qualifying service; or</li>
			<li>If you are a member of the National Guard or other reserve
				component of the U.S. Armed Forces (current or retired) and you are
				called or ordered to active duty while you are enrolled at least
				half-time at an eligible school or within 6 months of having been
				enrolled at least half-time, during the 13 months following the
				conclusion of your active duty service, or until you return to
				enrolled student status on at least a half-time basis, whichever is
				earlier.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You may be eligible to receive additional deferments if, at the
			time you received your first Direct Loan, you had an outstanding
			balance on a loan made under the FFEL Program before July 1, 1993. If
			you meet this requirement, contact your servicer for information
			about additional deferments that may be available.</p>
		<p>You may receive a deferment while you are enrolled in school on
			at least a half-time basis (and, if you are a graduate or
			professional student, during the 6-month period after you cease to be
			enrolled at least half-time) if:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You submit a deferment request to your servicer along with
				documentation of your eligibility for the deferment, or</li>
			<li>Your servicer receives information from the school you are
				attending that indicates you are enrolled at least half-time.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If your servicer processes a deferment based on information
			received from your school, you will be notified of the deferment and
			will have the option of canceling the deferment and continuing to
			make payments on your loan.</p>
		<p>For all other deferments, you (or, for a deferment based on
			active duty military service or qualifying National Guard duty during
			a war or other military operation or national emergency, a
			representative acting on your behalf) must submit a deferment request
			to your servicer, along with documentation of your eligibility for
			the deferment. In certain circumstances, you may not be required to
			provide documentation of your eligibility if your servicer confirms
			that you have been granted the same deferment for the same period of
			time on a FFEL Program loan. Your servicer can provide you with a
			deferment request form that explains the eligibility and
			documentation requirements for the type of deferment you are
			requesting. You may also obtain deferment request forms and
			information on deferment eligibility requirements from your
			servicer's web site.</p>

			to, financial hardship and illness.<br> We will give you a
			forbearance if:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You are serving in a medical or dental internship or
				residency program, and you meet specific requirements;</li>
			<li>The total amount you owe each month for all of the student
				loans you received under Title IV of the Act (Direct Loan Program
				loans, FFEL Program loans, and Federal Perkins Loans) is 20% or more
				of your total monthly gross income (for a maximum of three years);</li>
			<li>You are serving in a national service position for which you
				receive a national service education award under the National and
				Community Service Trust Act of 1993. In some cases, the interest
				that accrues on a qualified loan during the service period will be
				paid by the Corporation for National and Community Service;</li>
			<li>You qualify for partial repayment of your loans under a
				student loan repayment program administered by the Department of
				Defense; or</li>
			<li>You are called to active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>To request a forbearance, contact your servicer. Your servicer
			can explain the eligibility and documentation requirements for the
			type of forbearance you are requesting. You may also obtain
			information on forbearance eligibility requirements from your

			without requiring you to submit a request or documentation. These
			circumstances include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>

			FORGIVEN)</p>
		<b>Death, bankruptcy, and total and permanent disability </b>
		<p>We will discharge (forgive) your loan if:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You die, or the child on whose behalf you obtained a Direct
				PLUS Loan dies. Your servicer must receive acceptable documentation
				(as defined in the Act) of your death or the child's death.</li>
			<li>Your loan is discharged in bankruptcy after you have proven
				to the bankruptcy court that repaying the loan would cause undue
				hardship. Direct Loans are not automatically discharged if you file
				for bankruptcy.</li>
			<li>You become totally and permanently disabled (as defined in
				the Act) and meet certain other requirements.</li>
		</ul>
		<b>School closure, false certification, identity theft, and unpaid
			refund</b><br>
		<p>In certain cases, we may also discharge all or a portion of
			your loan if:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You (or the child on whose behalf you obtained a Direct PLUS
				Loan) could not complete a program of study because the school
				closed;</li>
			<li>Your loan eligibility was falsely certified by the school;</li>
			<li>A loan in your name was falsely certified as a result of a
				crime of identity theft; or</li>
			<li>The school did not pay a refund of your loan money that it
				was required to pay under federal regulations.</li>
		</ul>
		<b>Public Service Loan Forgiveness</b>
		<p>A Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program is also
			available. Under this program, we will forgive the remaining balance
			due on your eligible Direct Loan Program loans after you have made
			120 payments on those loans (after October 1, 2007) under certain
			repayment plans while you are employed full-time in certain public
			service jobs. The required 120 payments do not have to be
			consecutive. Qualifying repayment plans include the REPAYE Plan, the
			PAYE Plan, the IBR Plan, the ICR Plan, and the Standard Repayment
			Plan with a 10-year repayment period.</p>
		<p>
			<b>Note:</b> Although the Standard Repayment Plan with a 10-year
			repayment period is a qualifying repayment plan for PSLF, to receive
			any loan forgiveness under this program you must make the majority of
			the required 120 payments under the REPAYE Plan, the PAYE Plan, the
			IBR Plan, or the ICR Plan.
		</p>
		<b>Additional loan discharge information</b>
		<p>The Act may provide for certain loan forgiveness or repayment
			benefits on your loans in addition to the benefits described above.</p>
		<p>For a discharge based on your death or the death of the child
			on whose behalf you obtained a Direct PLUS Loan, a family member must
			contact your loan servicer. To request loan discharge or forgiveness
			based on one of the other conditions described above (except for a
			discharge due to bankruptcy), you must complete an application. Your
			servicer can tell you how to apply.</p>
		<p>In some cases, you may assert, under applicable law and
			regulations, a defense against repayment of your loan on the basis
			that the school did something wrong or failed to do something that it
			should have done. You can make such a defense against repayment only
			if the school's act or omission directly relates to your loan or to
			the educational services that the loan was intended to pay for. If
			you believe that you have a defense against repayment of your loan,
			contact your servicer.</p>
		<p>We do not guarantee the quality of the academic programs
			provided by schools that participate in federal student financial aid
			programs. You must repay your loan even if you or (if you are a
			parent borrower) the student do not complete the education paid for
			with the loan, are unable to obtain employment in the field of study
			for which the school provided training, or are dissatisfied with, or
			do not receive, the education paid for with the loan.</p>
		<div class=table-space></div>
		<p class="note-to-endorser">
			<b>NOTE TO ENDORSER</b><br>If we discharge the full amount of
			the borrower's loan for any of the reasons described above, you are
			no longer obligated to make any payments on the loan. However, if the
			loan is reinstated after a discharge and the borrower does not make
			the required payments, you will be obligated to make payments on the
			loan.
		</p>
		<p class="text__subheader">23. LOAN CONSOLIDATION</p>
		<p>A Direct Consolidation Loan Program is available that allows
			you to consolidate one or more of your eligible federal education
			loans into a new loan with a single monthly payment, and may allow
			you to extend the period of time that you have to repay your loans.
			This may make it easier for you to repay your loans. However, you
			will pay more interest if you extend your repayment period through
			consolidation, since you will be making payments for a longer period
			of time. Contact your servicer for more information about loan
			consolidation.</p>
		<div class=table-space></div>
		<p class="note-to-endorser">
			<b>NOTE TO ENDORSER</b><br>You are not eligible to apply for a
			Direct Consolidation Loan to repay a Direct PLUS Loan for which you
			are the endorser.
		</p>
		<p class="text__subheader">24. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND OTHER
			FEDERAL AGENCY LOAN REPAYMENT</p>
		<p>Under certain circumstances, military personnel may have their
			federal education loans repaid by the Secretary of Defense. This
			benefit is offered as part of a recruitment program that does not
			apply to individuals based on their previous military service or to
			those who are not eligible for enlistment in the U.S. Armed Forces.
			For more information, contact your local military service recruitment
			office.
		<p>Other agencies of the federal government may also offer student
			loan repayment programs as an incentive to recruit and retain
			employees. Contact the agency's human resources department for more
			information.</p>
